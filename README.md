# React Native Bubbles

A React Native UI Kit

## Getting Started

This projecty was developed on Windows and tested on Android.
Prerequisites are to have React Native installed and an emulator setup.

- Run `npm i` to install all the dependencies
- To preview all the components using Storybook, run storybook with `npm run storybook`
  - A browser window should open with the Storybook server running
  - Run the application with `npx react-native start` and `npx react-native run-android`
  - Once the app loads on the emulator, Storybook's server's sidebar should be populated with stories.
  - Clicking on the stories in the web UI will now render that story in the emulator
